# 🌪️ SPILLEDTEA: Spill Tea • Blog Wild • Dream Deep


> *Where random rants meet raw revelation. Blogging. Tea-spilling. Soul-baring poetry.*

## Welcome to the Whirlwind! ☕✨

This is my digital den of delightful disorder—a space for:
- **Juicy Tea-Spilling**: Unfiltered gossip, pop culture scandals, life’s hidden truths
- **Random Blogging**: Viral trends, midnight musings, quirky hot takes
- **Psyche Poetry**: My poetic plunge into existence’s electric undercurrents

## A Poetic Peek Into My Worldview 🌑💎

In the world of rush where everyone scars the everyone,
Voids stare at our eyes and we stand in front of the mirror,
Hearts pulse like chain of lighting, and everyone is busy to squash others,
Fashion to be shown,and thoughts to be destroyed.
Every creativity is like rebelion and everyone tries to be the government,
Reality weeps, and We still write to make our imagination a known.
